_Uniswap price challenge_

We would love for you to whip up a chart UI to display the live price of Uniswap trading pairs using your preferred web development framework.

Bonus points if it live updates as the price changes, and also gets the prices from old blocks to show a portion the price history (maybe prior 100 block or so?).
